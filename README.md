## 🗂️ **Detailed Syllabus & Assignment Index**

| Assignment No. | Description |
|:--------------:|:------------|
| **1** | **Image Enhancement:**<br>Read an 8-bit image and apply techniques:<br>- Brightness improvement<br>- Brightness reduction<br>- Thresholding<br>- Negative of an image<br>- Log transformation<br>- Power Law transformation |
| **2** | **Histogram & Filtering:**<br>Read an image, plot its histogram, perform histogram equalization, comment on results. Implement spatial and frequency domain filters. |
| **3** | **Image Sampling & Quantization:**<br>Analyze sampling and quantization on images. Find quantized levels in color models. |
| **4** | **Noise Models:**<br>Evaluate noise effects (Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, Impulse) on image datasets. Generate histograms for each noise model. |
| **5** | **Contrast Enhancement:**<br>Contrast stretching of low contrast images. Compare histograms. Histogram equalization for uniform pixel distribution. |
| **6** | **Image Restoration:**<br>Apply filtering techniques (Inverse & Wiener filters) on noisy/distorted image datasets. Comment on filtering effects. |
| **7** | **Image Compression:**<br>Implement compression using DCT Transform & Huffman Coding. Compare lossy vs. lossless compression. Report findings and suggest suitable technique. |
